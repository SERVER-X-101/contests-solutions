## Problem Statement: Maximum XOR of Two Numbers

In a world of magical numbers, a pair of numbers, `x` and `y`, was considered special if `|x - y|` was less than or equal to the smaller number. Your task is to find two numbers from this set that create the most powerful pair, where their XOR is the highest among all pairs meeting this rule.

Return the maximum XOR value out of all possible strong pairs in the array `nums`.

Note that you can pick the same integer twice to form a pair.

### Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of elements in the array.
  - The second line contains `N` space-separated integers, the elements of the array.

### Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum XOR value out of all possible strong pairs in the array `nums`.

### Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 2^20 - 1

### Sample Input

```terminal

4 4 10 3 10
```

### Sample Output

```terminal
